This project is multi-platform thanks to Lazarus + FPC

### Summary

While the main market for 3D models is modellers and 3D game creation marketplace like Unity and Unreal Engine there exists a large potential market for 3D assets by the 2D-focused Game Engines aimed at the hobbyist aspirational game developer. 

Examples of the main players in this segment are RPG Maker, GameMaker Studio 2 and Godot Engine - there are many, many more but these are the big three and they all have millions of users.

When it comes to assets for 2D games there is a market but it is dwarfed by the number of 3D models available. 

It is quite feasible to take a 3D model and create Sprites from it for use in the 2D Game Engines - This is where the concept got Spritely originates from.

It is especially notable that 2D Animated Character Sprites are hard to find. This is the problem that Spritely solves. You simply find a suitable 3D model, import it into Spritely select the poses and frames you want for your 2D Sprites and Spritely creates the required artwork for you in as many directions and from whatever angles you choose.

Of course, this process also works perfectly with inanimate models as well so objects to fill your new world work exactly the same way.

Spritely is pre-configured to cater for all 2D art styles whether you're creating Flat 2D, JRPG, Isometric or Military (like Ultima 7) viewpoints. ***
